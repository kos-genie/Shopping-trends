I chose Customer Shopping (Latest Trends)Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fbhadramohit%2Fcustomer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset). Uploaded the csv on github for easier access.

How does shopping spending vary based on age and gender?
Which item types do people pay more for on average?
Does shopping spending vary seasonally and geographically? Do people spend more to prepare for winter in colder states/summer in the coastal states?
